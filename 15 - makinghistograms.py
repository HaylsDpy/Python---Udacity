# Make a histogram of each of the 3 metrics we looked at for bboth students who pass the subway project and those who don't - 6 histograms
# Add 'plt.hist(data)' to the 'describe_data' function in document number 11
# Edit the function and re-run the later cells to have your histogram appear next to the summary stats



# import matplotlib.pyploy as plt
# import numpy as np

# def describe_data(data):

#   print('Standard Deviation:', np.std(data))
#   print('Minimum:', np.min(data))
#   print('Maximum:', np.max(data))
#   plt.hist(data)

# total_minutes = total_minutes_by_account.values()
# describe_data(total_minutes)
